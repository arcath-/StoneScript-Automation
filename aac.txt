/*

Weapons have four states, used internally to determine what animations to
display and if the weapon is allowed to begin dealing damage or not. The 
relevant one for AAC is called "perf", or just state 3. By interrupting the
animation while it is in "perf", you can force it to proceed to state 4,
"cooldown", instantly, rather than waiting for all frames of "perf" to
happen before it then begins "cooldown". Because "perf" is used to indicate
to the game weapon animation frames to draw, a characteristic of AAC is to
make weapon swing animations cut off prematurely. This has no effect on
damage output; in fact, the whole point of AAC is to increase damage output. 

Skeleton Arm and Rune Staffs while using Berserk Potions and attack speed
enhancements, will not interact correctly with the AAC script below.
